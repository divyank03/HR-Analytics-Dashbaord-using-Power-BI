# HR-Analytics-Dashbaord-using-Power-BI

## Project Objective
To design and develop an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI that consolidates and visualizes key workforce data—such as employee headcount, attrition rate, tenure, and diversity metrics—in order to support strategic HR decision-making, enhance visibility into workforce trends, and enable data-driven planning for recruitment, retention, and employee engagement.

## 🧩 Business Problem
The HR team was managing large volumes of employee data across scattered Excel sheets, making it difficult to track key workforce metrics such as attrition rate, headcount, tenure, and diversity. This lack of visibility and real-time insights hindered data-driven decision-making, making it challenging to identify high-attrition departments, monitor diversity goals, and plan effective hiring or retention strategies.

There was a strong need for a centralized, interactive dashboard that could transform raw HR data into actionable insights to support strategic workforce planning and improve overall organizational performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used:
- Power BI	- Dashboard development, data visualization, and report sharing.
- Power Query	- Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation (ETL).
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)	- Creating calculated columns, measures, and KPIs.
- Excel	- Source of raw HR data; initial data handling and exploration.
- Data Modeling (Star Schema)	- Structured relationships for optimized performance and scalability.
